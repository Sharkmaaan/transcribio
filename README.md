Transcripio
Live Demo: www.transcripio.com
A Django-based web application that automatically transcribes video and audio files using OpenAI's Whisper API, with optional AI-powered transcript polishing via ChatGPT.

üéØ Project Overview
Transcriptio was built to solve a real-world problem: efficiently transcribing interview recordings for content creation projects. As a professional copywriter transitioning into web development, I needed a tool that could handle both raw transcription and produce polished, readable text.

Key Features

Video & Audio Upload: Supports multiple file formats (MP4, MP3, WAV, etc.)
Dual Transcription Output:

Raw transcription via Whisper API
AI-polished version via ChatGPT (optional)


API Key Management: Users provide their own OpenAI API keys (encrypted at rest)
Secure File Handling: Automatic cleanup and encrypted storage
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
